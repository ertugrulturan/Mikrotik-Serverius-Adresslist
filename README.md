Dear Customer,

After careful consideration, we have decided to discontinue Qbine effective 2025-02-01.

Why Are We Making This Change?

As part of our commitment to driving innovation and delivering better solutions for our customers, we are streamlining our product portfolio to focus on products that provide the most value. By retiring certain legacy products, we can dedicate more resources to developing cutting-edge solutions that meet your evolving needs. Unfortunately, this includes the discontinuation of Qbine.

What Does This Mean for You?

    Termination Date: 2025-02-01
    Next Steps: To avoid disruption, you must transition away from Qbine by the termination date.
    Alternative Solutions: We understand the importance of maintaining a strong security posture for your web applications. As an alternative, we suggest exploring solutions from leading providers in the market, such as Cloudflare, Akamai, Imperva, Barracuda Networks, and others. These companies offer a range of web security and performance products that may suit your needs in the future.
    We are here to support you during the transition. Please contact our support team or your Account Manager if you have any questions or need assistance.

We greatly appreciate your understanding and continued trust in our services.

Warm regards,
Your dedicated Serverius Team
```
